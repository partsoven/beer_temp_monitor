beer_temp_monitor
=================

A simple temperature logger that uses an Arduino, the arduino ethernet shield, a TMP36 temp sensor, and COSM.com to show the data in realtime. We use it to keep an eye on the temp of our fermentation vessels.

To use this you will need to sign up for a COSM.com account and create a feed and fill the arduino code in with the info.
